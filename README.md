# Building a custom object detector using YOLO

In this repository, I put the code and the dataset of my rubik's cube to building a custom object detector to detect it. I implemented the detector with YOLOv2 in <strong>Java</strong> using Deeplearning4j library and in <strong>Python</strong> using YOLOv3 training process is done using the Darknet framework and the real-time detector implemented with OpenCV DNN module.
